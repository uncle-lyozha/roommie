Roomie is a Telegram bot designed to help roommates maintain a shared cleaning schedule effortlessly. Built with NestJS-Telegraf and powered by MongoDB Atlas, it offers a seamless experience for coordinating household chores.

Key Features:
Automated Task Assignments: Every Monday, Roomie sends a notification to the group chat and privately messages users with their assigned cleaning tasks for the week.
Smart Reminders: From Thursday to Saturday, Roomie sends gentle reminders to users about their pending tasks, allowing them to snooze reminders if needed.
Final Notices: On Sundays, users receive final reminders. Failure to mark tasks as done results in task failure.

Additional Features:
Easy Configuration: Roomie allows users to add rooms, define tasks, and assign users through a user-friendly Wizard interface.
Customizable Settings: Future updates will include commands for adjusting various settings to tailor the bot's behavior to specific household needs.
